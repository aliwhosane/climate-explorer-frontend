    title: '# PCIC Climate Explorer (PCEX)'
    description: |
      A tool for visualizing and downloading climate model outputs and data derived from those outputs.

      The PCIC Climate Explorer (PCEX) is also fondly known as 'the marmot,' since it is an improvement
      (we sincerely hope) on its predecessor, the Regional Analysis Tool, or 'RAT.' Hence our mascot in the header.
